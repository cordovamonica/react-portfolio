      <p>
        I initially graduated in 2016 with a degree in Psychology. After years
        of not pursuing anything with my degree and bouncing from job to job
        feeling unfulfilled, I decided to make a change. I enrolled in a coding
        bootcamp thru University of Texas San Antonio and started my path to a career change. Coding is a
        challenge but having the chance to collaborate with my peers and take
        part in creating or bettering something in the world will have great
        payoff.

        I am currently based in Dallas, TX. After graduating from the bootcamp,
        I hope to pursue a career as a full stack web developer and continue
        learning and growing as a developer. I enjoy walking, spoiling my dog, reading,
        and games.
